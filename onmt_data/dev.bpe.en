then i watched while the lam@@ b opened the first of the seven sea@@ ls . i heard one of the four living cre@@ at@@ ures say with a voice like th@@ under , “ come ! ”
i looked , and there before me was a white hor@@ se . the ri@@ der on the hor@@ se held a bow , and he was given a crown , and he ro@@ de out , determined to win the victory .
when the lam@@ b opened the second sea@@ l , i heard the second living cre@@ ature say , “ come ! ”
then another hor@@ se came out , a red one . its ri@@ der was given power to take away peace from the earth and to make people kill each other , and he was given a big sword .
when the lam@@ b opened the third sea@@ l , i heard the third living cre@@ ature say , “ come ! ” i looked , and there before me was a black hor@@ se , and its ri@@ der held a pa@@ ir of scal@@ es in his hand .
then i heard something that s@@ ounded like a voice coming from the middle of the four living cre@@ at@@ ures . the voice said , “ a quar@@ t of wh@@ eat for a day ’ s pay , and three quar@@ ts of bar@@ le@@ y for a day ’ s pay , and do not damage the o@@ live oil and wine ! ”

when the lam@@ b opened the fifth sea@@ l , i saw under the altar the souls of those who had been killed because they were faithful to the word of god and to the message they had received .
these souls shouted in a loud voice , “ holy and true lord , how long until you judge the people of the earth and punish them for killing us ? ”
then each one of them was given a white robe and was told to wait a short time longer . there were still some of their fellow servants and brothers and sisters in the service of christ who must be killed as they were . they had to wait until all of this was finished .

after the vision of these things i saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth . the angels were holding the four winds of the earth to keep them from b@@ lowing on the land or on the sea or on any tree .

he said to them , “ do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we mark with a sign the fore@@ heads of the people who serve our god . ”
then i heard how many people were marked with the sign . there were one hundred forty-@@ four thousand from every tribe of the people of israel .
from the tribe of judah twelve thousand were marked with the sign , from the tribe of re@@ u@@ b@@ en twelve thousand , from the tribe of ga@@ d twelve thousand ,
from the tribe of a@@ sh@@ er twelve thousand , from the tribe of na@@ ph@@ tal@@ i twelve thousand , from the tribe of man@@ as@@ se@@ h twelve thousand ,
from the tribe of simeon twelve thousand , from the tribe of levi twelve thousand , from the tribe of is@@ sac@@ ha@@ r twelve thousand ,
from the tribe of zebu@@ lu@@ n twelve thousand , from the tribe of joseph twelve thousand , and from the tribe of ben@@ jam@@ in twelve thousand were marked with the sign .
after the vision of these things i looked , and there was a great number of people , so many that no one could coun@@ t them . they were from every nation , tribe , people , and language of the earth . they were all standing before the throne and before the lam@@ b , wearing white ro@@ bes and holding palm branches in their hands .
they were shouting in a loud voice , “ salvation belongs to our god , who s@@ its on the throne , and to the lam@@ b . ”
all the angels were standing around the throne and the elders and the four living cre@@ at@@ ures . they all bowed down on their faces before the throne and worshiped god ,
saying , “ amen ! praise , glory , wisdom , thanks , honor , power , and strength belong to our god forever and ever . amen ! ”
then one of the elders asked me , “ who are these people dressed in white ro@@ bes ? where did they come from ? ”
i answered , “ you know , sir . ” and the elder said to me , “ these are the people who have come out of the great dist@@ ress . they have washed their ro@@ bes and made them white in the blood of the lam@@ b .
because of this , they are before the throne of god . they worship him day and night in his temple . and the one who s@@ its on the throne will be present with them .
those people will never be hungry again , and they will never be thirsty again . the sun will not hurt them , and no hea@@ t will burn them ,
because the lam@@ b at the center of the throne will be their shepherd . he will lead them to sp@@ r@@ ings of water that give life . and god will wi@@ pe away every tear from their eyes . ”
when the lam@@ b opened the seventh sea@@ l , there was sil@@ ence in heaven for about half an hour .
and i saw the seven angels who stand before god and to whom were given seven trum@@ pe@@ ts .
another angel came and stood at the altar , holding a gol@@ den p@@ an for inc@@ ense . he was given much inc@@ ense to offer with the prayers of all god ’ s holy people . the angel put this offering on the gol@@ den altar before the throne .
the smoke from the inc@@ ense went up from the angel ’ s hand to god with the prayers of god ’ s people .
then the angel filled the inc@@ ense p@@ an with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth , and there were fla@@ shes of lightning , th@@ under and loud no@@ i@@ ses , and an ear@@ th@@ qua@@ ke .
then the seven angels who had the seven trum@@ pe@@ ts prepared to b@@ low them .
the first angel ble@@ w his trum@@ pet , and ha@@ il and fire mixed with blood were poured down on the earth . and a third of the earth , and all the green grass , and a third of the trees were bur@@ ned up .
then the second angel ble@@ w his trum@@ pet , and something that looked like a big mountain , burning with fire , was thrown into the sea . and a third of the sea became blood ,
a third of the living things in the sea died , and a third of the ships were destroyed .
then the third angel ble@@ w his trum@@ pet , and a large star , burning like a tor@@ ch , fell from the sky . it fell on a third of the rivers and on the sp@@ r@@ ings of water .
the name of the star is wor@@ m@@ wood . and a third of all the water became bit@@ ter , and many people died from drinking the water that was bit@@ ter .
then the fourth angel ble@@ w his trum@@ pet , and a third of the sun , and a third of the moon , and a third of the stars were struck . so a third of them became dark , and a third of the day was without light , and also the night .
while i watched , i heard an ea@@ g@@ le that was f@@ lying high in the air cry out in a loud voice , “ trouble ! trouble ! trouble for those who live on the earth because of the rema@@ ining s@@ ounds of the trum@@ pe@@ ts that the other three angels are about to b@@ low ! ”
then the fifth angel ble@@ w his trum@@ pet , and i saw a star fall from the sky to the earth . the star was given the key to the deep hole that leads to the bot@@ tom@@ less p@@ it .
then it opened up the hole that leads to the bot@@ tom@@ less p@@ it , and smoke came up from the hole like smoke from a big furn@@ ace . then the sun and sky became dark because of the smoke from the hole .
then locusts came down to the earth out of the smoke , and they were given the power to sting like scor@@ pi@@ ons .
they were told not to harm the grass on the earth or any plant or tree . they could harm only the people who did not have the sign of god on their fore@@ heads .
these locusts were not given the power to kill anyone , but to cause pain to the people for five months . and the pain they felt was like the pain a scor@@ pi@@ on gives when it st@@ ings someone .
during those days people will look for a way to die , but they will not find it . they will want to die , but death will run away from them .
the locusts looked like hor@@ ses prepared for battle . on their heads they wore what looked like crow@@ ns of gold , and their faces looked like human faces .
their hair was like women ’ s hair , and their teeth were like lions ’ teeth .
their ch@@ ests looked like iron breast@@ pl@@ ates , and the sound of their w@@ ings was like the noise of many hor@@ ses and chari@@ ots hur@@ rying into battle .
the locusts had ta@@ ils with st@@ ing@@ ers like scor@@ pi@@ ons , and in their ta@@ ils was their power to hurt people for five months .
the locusts had a king who was the angel of the bot@@ tom@@ less p@@ it . his name in the hebrew language is ab@@ ad@@ don and in the greek language is apo@@ ll@@ y@@ on .
the first trouble is past ; there are still two other troubles that will come .
then the sixth angel ble@@ w his trum@@ pet , and i heard a voice coming from the hor@@ ns on the gol@@ den altar that is before god .
the voice said to the sixth angel who had the trum@@ pet , “ free the four angels who are tied at the great river eu@@ ph@@ rates . ”
and they let lo@@ ose the four angels who had been kept ready for this hour and day and month and year so they could kill a third of all people on the earth .
i heard how many tro@@ ops on hor@@ ses were in their army — two hundred million .
the hor@@ ses and their riders i saw in the vision looked like this : they had breast@@ pl@@ ates that were fi@@ ery red , dark bl@@ ue , and yellow like sul@@ fu@@ r . the heads of the hor@@ ses looked like heads of lions , with fire , smoke , and sul@@ fu@@ r coming out of their mouths .
a third of all the people on earth were killed by these three terrible disa@@ sters coming out of the hor@@ ses ’ mouths : the fire , the smoke , and the sul@@ fu@@ r .
the hor@@ ses ’ power was in their mouths and in their ta@@ ils ; their ta@@ ils were like snakes with heads , and with them they hurt people .
the other people who were not killed by these terrible disa@@ sters still did not change their hearts and turn away from what they had made with their own hands . they did not stop worshi@@ ping demons and idols made of gold , silver , br@@ on@@ ze , stone , and wood — things that cannot see or hear or walk .
these people did not change their hearts and turn away from murder or evil magi@@ c , from their sexual sins or stealing .
then i saw another powerful angel coming down from heaven dressed in a cloud with a rain@@ bow over his head . his face was like the sun , and his legs were like pillars of fire .
the angel was holding a small s@@ cro@@ ll open in his hand . he put his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land .
then he shouted loudly like the ro@@ ar@@ ing of a lion . and when he shouted , the vo@@ ices of seven th@@ und@@ ers spoke .
when the seven th@@ und@@ ers spoke , i started to write . but i heard a voice from heaven say , “ keep hidden what the seven th@@ und@@ ers said , and do not write them down . ”
then the angel i saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven ,
and he made a promise by the power of the one who lives forever and ever . he is the one who made the sk@@ ies and all that is in them , the earth and all that is in it , and the sea and all that is in it . the angel promised , “ there will be no more waiting !
in the days when the seventh angel is ready to b@@ low his trum@@ pet , god ’ s secret will be finished . this secret is the good news god told to his servants , the prophets . ”
then i heard the same voice from heaven again , saying to me : “ go and take the open s@@ cro@@ ll that is in the hand of the angel that is standing on the sea and on the land . ”
so i went to the angel and told him to give me the small s@@ cro@@ ll . and he said to me , “ take the s@@ cro@@ ll and eat it . it will be s@@ our in your stomach , but in your mouth it will be swe@@ et as honey . ”
so i took the small s@@ cro@@ ll from the angel ’ s hand and ate it . in my mouth it ta@@ sted swe@@ et as honey , but after i ate it , it was s@@ our in my stomach .
then i was told , “ you must prophes@@ y again about many peo@@ ples , nations , languages , and kings . ”
i was given a mea@@ sur@@ ing stick like a ro@@ d , and i was told , “ go and mea@@ sure the temple of god and the altar , and coun@@ t the people worshi@@ ping there .
but do not mea@@ sure the yard outside the temple . leave it alone , because it has been given to those who are not god ’ s people . and they will tra@@ m@@ ple on the holy city for forty-@@ two months .
and i will give power to my two witnesses to prophes@@ y for one thousand two hundred sixty days , and they will be dressed in rou@@ gh cloth to show their sadness . ”
these two witnesses are the two o@@ live trees and the two lamp@@ stands that stand before the lord of the earth .
and if anyone tries to hurt them , fire comes from their mouths and kill@@ s their enemies . and if anyone tries to hurt them in whatever way , in that same way that person will die .
these witnesses have the power to stop the sky from raining during the time they are prophes@@ ying . and they have power to make the wa@@ ters become blood , and they have power to send every kind of trouble to the earth as many times as they want .
when the two witnesses have finished telling their message , the b@@ east that comes up from the bot@@ tom@@ less p@@ it will fight a war against them . he will defeat them and kill them .
the bodies of the two witnesses will lie in the street of the great city where the lord was killed . this city is named so@@ dom and egypt , which has a spiritual meaning .
those from every race of people , tribe , language , and nation will look at the bodies of the two witnesses for three and one-@@ half days , and they will refuse to bury them .
people who live on the earth will rejo@@ ice and be happy because these two are dead . they will send each other gifts , because these two prophets brought much suffering to those who live on the earth .
but after three and one-@@ half days , god put the bre@@ ath of life into the two prophets again . they stood on their feet , and everyone who saw them became very afraid .
then the two prophets heard a loud voice from heaven saying , “ come up here ! ” and they went up into heaven in a cloud as their enemies watched .
in the same hour there was a great ear@@ th@@ qua@@ ke , and a tenth of the city was destroyed . seven thousand people were killed in the ear@@ th@@ qua@@ ke , and those who did not die were very afraid and gave glory to the god of heaven .
the second trouble is finished . pay attention : the third trouble is coming soon .
then the seventh angel ble@@ w his trum@@ pet . and there were loud vo@@ ices in heaven , saying : “ the power to rule the world now belongs to our lord and his christ , and he will rule forever and ever . ”
then the twenty-four elders , who sit on their thr@@ ones before god , bowed down on their faces and worshiped god .
they said : “ we give thanks to you , lord god al@@ mi@@ gh@@ ty , who is and who was , because you have used your great power and have be@@ gun to rule !
the people of the world were angry , but your anger has come . the time has come to judge the dead , and to reward your servants the prophets and your holy people , all who respect you , great and small . the time has come to destroy those who destroy the earth ! ”
then god ’ s temple in heaven was opened . the ar@@ k that holds the agreement god gave to his people could be seen in his temple . then there were fla@@ shes of lightning , no@@ i@@ ses , th@@ under , an ear@@ th@@ qua@@ ke , and a great ha@@ il@@ storm .
and then a great wonder appeared in heaven : a woman was cloth@@ ed with the sun , and the moon was under her feet , and a crown of twelve stars was on her head .
she was pregnant and cried out with pain , because she was about to give birth .
then another wonder appeared in heaven : there was a gi@@ ant red dra@@ g@@ on with seven heads and seven crow@@ ns on each head . he also had ten hor@@ ns .
his tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and threw them down to the earth . he stood in front of the woman who was ready to give birth so he could eat her baby as soon as it was born .
then the woman gave birth to a son who will rule all the nations with an iron ro@@ d . and her child was taken up to god and to his throne .
the woman ran away into the desert to a place god prepared for her where she would be taken care of for one thousand two hundred sixty days .
then there was a war in heaven . mi@@ cha@@ el and his angels fought against the dra@@ g@@ on , and the dra@@ g@@ on and his angels fought back .
but the dra@@ g@@ on was not strong enough , and he and his angels lost their place in heaven .
the gi@@ ant dra@@ g@@ on was thrown down out of heaven . ( he is that old snake called the devil or satan , who tric@@ ks the whole world . ) the dra@@ g@@ on with his angels was thrown down to the earth .
then i heard a loud voice in heaven saying : “ the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our god and the authority of his christ have now come . the accu@@ ser of our brothers and sisters , who accused them day and night before our god , has been thrown down .
and our brothers and sisters defeated him by the blood of the lam@@ b ’ s death and by the message they preached . they did not love their lives so much that they were afraid of death .
so rejo@@ ice , you heaven@@ s and all who live there ! but it will be terrible for the earth and the sea , because the devil has come down to you ! he is filled with anger , because he knows he does not have much time . ”
when the dra@@ g@@ on saw he had been thrown down to the earth , he hun@@ ted for the woman who had given birth to the son .
but the woman was given the two w@@ ings of a great ea@@ g@@ le so she could f@@ ly to the place prepared for her in the desert . there she would be taken care of for three and one-@@ half years , away from the snake .
then the snake poured water out of its mouth like a river toward the woman so the flood would carry her away .
but the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and sw@@ allow@@ ing the river that came from the mouth of the dra@@ g@@ on .
then the dra@@ g@@ on was very angry at the woman , and he went off to make war against all her other children — those who obey god ’ s commands and who have the message jesus taught .
and the dra@@ g@@ on stood on the sea@@ shore . then i saw a b@@ east coming up out of the sea . it had ten hor@@ ns and seven heads , and there was a crown on each hor@@ n . a name against god was written on each head .
this b@@ east looked like a le@@ o@@ par@@ d , with feet like a b@@ ear ’ s feet and a mouth like a lion ’ s mouth . and the dra@@ g@@ on gave the b@@ east all of his power and his throne and great authority .
one of the heads of the b@@ east looked as if it had been killed by a w@@ ound , but this death w@@ ound was healed . then the whole world was amazed and followed the b@@ east .
people worshiped the dra@@ g@@ on because he had given his power to the b@@ east . and they also worshiped the b@@ east , asking , “ who is like the b@@ east ? who can make war against it ? ”
the b@@ east was allowed to say proud words and words against god , and it was allowed to use its power for forty-@@ two months .
it used its mouth to speak against god , against god ’ s name , against the place where god lives , and against all those who live in heaven .
it was given power to make war against god ’ s holy people and to defeat them . it was given power over every tribe , people , language , and nation .
and all who live on earth will worship the b@@ east — all the people since the beginning of the world whose names are not written in the lam@@ b ’ s book of life . the lam@@ b is the one who was killed .
anyone who has ears should listen :
if you are to be a prisoner , then you will be a prisoner . if you are to be killed with the sword , then you will be killed with the sword . this means that god ’ s holy people must have patience and faith .
then i saw another b@@ east coming up out of the earth . it had two hor@@ ns like a lam@@ b , but it spoke like a dra@@ g@@ on .
this b@@ east stands before the first b@@ east and uses the same power the first b@@ east has . by this power it makes everyone living on earth worship the first b@@ east , who had the death w@@ ound that was healed .
and the second b@@ east does great miracles so that it even makes fire come down from heaven to earth while people are watching .
it fools those who live on earth by the miracles it has been given the power to do . it does these miracles to serve the first b@@ east . the second b@@ east orders people to make an ido@@ l to honor the first b@@ east , the one that was w@@ ounded by the deadly sword but sp@@ ran@@ g to life again .
the second b@@ east was given power to give life to the ido@@ l of the first one so that the ido@@ l could speak . and the second b@@ east was given power to command all who will not worship the image of the b@@ east to be killed .
the second b@@ east also forced all people , small and great , rich and poor , free and slave , to have a mark on their right hand or on their fore@@ head .
no one could buy or sell without this mark , which is the name of the b@@ east or the number of its name .
this takes wisdom . let the one who has understanding find the meaning of the number , which is the number of a person . its number is 6@@ 6@@ 6 .
then i looked , and there before me was the lam@@ b standing on mount z@@ i@@ on . with him were one hundred forty-@@ four thousand people who had his name and his father ’ s name written on their fore@@ heads .
and i heard a sound from heaven like the noise of flooding water and like the sound of loud th@@ under . the sound i heard was like people playing har@@ ps .
and they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living cre@@ at@@ ures and the elders . no one could learn the new song except the one hundred forty-@@ four thousand who had been bought from the earth .
these are the ones who did not do sinful things with women , because they kept themselves pure . they follow the lam@@ b every place he goes . these one hundred forty-@@ four thousand were bought from among the people of the earth as people to be offered to god and the lam@@ b .
they were not guilty of telling lies ; they are without fault .
then i saw another angel f@@ lying high in the air . he had the eternal good news to preach to those who live on earth — to every nation , tribe , language , and people .
he preached in a loud voice , “ fear god and give him praise , because the time has come for god to judge all people . so worship god who made the heaven@@ s , and the earth , and the sea , and the sp@@ r@@ ings of water . ”
then the second angel followed the first angel and said , “ ru@@ ined , ru@@ ined is the great city of bab@@ yl@@ on ! she made all the nations drink the wine of the anger of her adultery . ”
then a third angel followed the first two angels , saying in a loud voice : “ if anyone wor@@ ships the b@@ east and his ido@@ l and gets the b@@ east ’ s mark on the fore@@ head or on the hand ,
that one also will drink the wine of god ’ s anger , which is prepared with all its strength in the cup of his anger . and that person will be put in pain with burning sul@@ fu@@ r before the holy angels and the lam@@ b .
and the smoke from their burning pain will rise forever and ever . there will be no rest , day or night , for those who worship the b@@ east and his ido@@ l or who get the mark of his name . ”
this means god ’ s holy people must be patient . they must obey god ’ s commands and keep their faith in jesus .
then i heard a voice from heaven saying , “ write this : blessed are the dead who die from now on in the lord . ” the spirit says , “ yes , they will rest from their hard work , and the reward of all they have done sta@@ ys with them . ”
then i looked , and there before me was a white cloud , and sitting on the white cloud was one who looked like a son of man . he had a gold crown on his head and a shar@@ p sick@@ le in his hand .
then another angel came out of the temple and called out in a loud voice to the one who was sitting on the cloud , “ take your sick@@ le and harvest from the earth , because the time to harvest has come , and the fruit of the earth is ri@@ pe . ”
