Then I heard all creatures in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea saying : “ To the One who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honor and glory and power forever and ever . ”
The four living creatures said , “ Amen , ” and the elders bowed down and worshiped .
Then I watched while the Lamb opened the first of the seven seals . I heard one of the four living creatures say with a voice like thunder , “ Come ! ”
I looked , and there before me was a white horse . The rider on the horse held a bow , and he was given a crown , and he rode out , determined to win the victory .
When the Lamb opened the second seal , I heard the second living creature say , “ Come ! ”
Then another horse came out , a red one . Its rider was given power to take away peace from the earth and to make people kill each other , and he was given a big sword .
When the Lamb opened the third seal , I heard the third living creature say , “ Come ! ” I looked , and there before me was a black horse , and its rider held a pair of scales in his hand .
Then I heard something that sounded like a voice coming from the middle of the four living creatures . The voice said , “ A quart of wheat for a day ’ s pay , and three quarts of barley for a day ’ s pay , and do not damage the olive oil and wine ! ”
When the Lamb opened the fourth seal , I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say , “ Come ! ”
I looked , and there before me was a pale horse . Its rider was named death , and Hades was following close behind him . They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill people by war , by starvation , by disease , and by the wild animals of the earth .
When the Lamb opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been killed because they were faithful to the word of God and to the message they had received .
These souls shouted in a loud voice , “ Holy and true Lord , how long until you judge the people of the earth and punish them for killing us ? ”
Then each one of them was given a white robe and was told to wait a short time longer . There were still some of their fellow servants and brothers and sisters in the service of Christ who must be killed as they were . They had to wait until all of this was finished .
Then I watched while the Lamb opened the sixth seal , and there was a great earthquake . The sun became black like rough black cloth , and the whole moon became red like blood .
And the stars in the sky fell to the earth like figs falling from a fig tree when the wind blows .
The sky disappeared as a scroll when it is rolled up , and every mountain and island was moved from its place .
Then the kings of the earth , the rulers , the generals , the rich people , the powerful people , the slaves , and the free people hid themselves in caves and in the rocks on the mountains .
They called to the mountains and the rocks , “ Fall on us . Hide us from the face of the One who sits on the throne and from the anger of the Lamb !
The great day for their anger has come , and who can stand against it ? ”
After the vision of these things I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth . The angels were holding the four winds of the earth to keep them from blowing on the land or on the sea or on any tree .
Then I saw another angel coming up from the east who had the seal of the living God . And he called out in a loud voice to the four angels to whom God had given power to harm the earth and the sea .
He said to them , “ Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we mark with a sign the foreheads of the people who serve our God . ”
Then I heard how many people were marked with the sign . There were one hundred forty-four thousand from every tribe of the people of Israel .
From the tribe of Judah twelve thousand were marked with the sign , from the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand , from the tribe of Gad twelve thousand ,
from the tribe of Asher twelve thousand , from the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand , from the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand ,
from the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand , from the tribe of Levi twelve thousand , from the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand ,
from the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand , from the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand , and from the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand were marked with the sign .
After the vision of these things I looked , and there was a great number of people , so many that no one could count them . They were from every nation , tribe , people , and language of the earth . They were all standing before the throne and before the Lamb , wearing white robes and holding palm branches in their hands .
They were shouting in a loud voice , “ Salvation belongs to our God , who sits on the throne , and to the Lamb . ”
All the angels were standing around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures . They all bowed down on their faces before the throne and worshiped God ,
saying , “ Amen ! Praise , glory , wisdom , thanks , honor , power , and strength belong to our God forever and ever . Amen ! ”
Then one of the elders asked me , “ Who are these people dressed in white robes ? Where did they come from ? ”
I answered , “ You know , sir . ” And the elder said to me , “ These are the people who have come out of the great distress . They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb .
Because of this , they are before the throne of God . They worship him day and night in his temple . And the One who sits on the throne will be present with them .
Those people will never be hungry again , and they will never be thirsty again . The sun will not hurt them , and no heat will burn them ,
because the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd . He will lead them to springs of water that give life . And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes . ”
When the Lamb opened the seventh seal , there was silence in heaven for about half an hour .
And I saw the seven angels who stand before God and to whom were given seven trumpets .
Another angel came and stood at the altar , holding a golden pan for incense . He was given much incense to offer with the prayers of all God ’ s holy people . The angel put this offering on the golden altar before the throne .
The smoke from the incense went up from the angel ’ s hand to God with the prayers of God ’ s people .
Then the angel filled the incense pan with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth , and there were flashes of lightning , thunder and loud noises , and an earthquake .
Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to blow them .
The first angel blew his trumpet , and hail and fire mixed with blood were poured down on the earth . And a third of the earth , and all the green grass , and a third of the trees were burned up .
Then the second angel blew his trumpet , and something that looked like a big mountain , burning with fire , was thrown into the sea . And a third of the sea became blood ,
a third of the living things in the sea died , and a third of the ships were destroyed .
Then the third angel blew his trumpet , and a large star , burning like a torch , fell from the sky . It fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water .
The name of the star is Wormwood . And a third of all the water became bitter , and many people died from drinking the water that was bitter .
Then the fourth angel blew his trumpet , and a third of the sun , and a third of the moon , and a third of the stars were struck . So a third of them became dark , and a third of the day was without light , and also the night .
While I watched , I heard an eagle that was flying high in the air cry out in a loud voice , “ Trouble ! Trouble ! Trouble for those who live on the earth because of the remaining sounds of the trumpets that the other three angels are about to blow ! ”
Then the fifth angel blew his trumpet , and I saw a star fall from the sky to the earth . The star was given the key to the deep hole that leads to the bottomless pit .
Then it opened up the hole that leads to the bottomless pit , and smoke came up from the hole like smoke from a big furnace . Then the sun and sky became dark because of the smoke from the hole .
Then locusts came down to the earth out of the smoke , and they were given the power to sting like scorpions .
They were told not to harm the grass on the earth or any plant or tree . They could harm only the people who did not have the sign of God on their foreheads .
These locusts were not given the power to kill anyone , but to cause pain to the people for five months . And the pain they felt was like the pain a scorpion gives when it stings someone .
During those days people will look for a way to die , but they will not find it . They will want to die , but death will run away from them .
The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle . On their heads they wore what looked like crowns of gold , and their faces looked like human faces .
Their hair was like women ’ s hair , and their teeth were like lions ’ teeth .
Their chests looked like iron breastplates , and the sound of their wings was like the noise of many horses and chariots hurrying into battle .
The locusts had tails with stingers like scorpions , and in their tails was their power to hurt people for five months .
The locusts had a king who was the angel of the bottomless pit . His name in the Hebrew language is Abaddon and in the Greek language is Apollyon .
The first trouble is past ; there are still two other troubles that will come .
Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet , and I heard a voice coming from the horns on the golden altar that is before God .
The voice said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet , “ Free the four angels who are tied at the great river Euphrates . ”
And they let loose the four angels who had been kept ready for this hour and day and month and year so they could kill a third of all people on the earth .
I heard how many troops on horses were in their army — two hundred million .
The horses and their riders I saw in the vision looked like this : They had breastplates that were fiery red , dark blue , and yellow like sulfur . The heads of the horses looked like heads of lions , with fire , smoke , and sulfur coming out of their mouths .
A third of all the people on earth were killed by these three terrible disasters coming out of the horses ’ mouths : the fire , the smoke , and the sulfur .
The horses ’ power was in their mouths and in their tails ; their tails were like snakes with heads , and with them they hurt people .
The other people who were not killed by these terrible disasters still did not change their hearts and turn away from what they had made with their own hands . They did not stop worshiping demons and idols made of gold , silver , bronze , stone , and wood — things that cannot see or hear or walk .
These people did not change their hearts and turn away from murder or evil magic , from their sexual sins or stealing .
Then I saw another powerful angel coming down from heaven dressed in a cloud with a rainbow over his head . His face was like the sun , and his legs were like pillars of fire .
The angel was holding a small scroll open in his hand . He put his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land .
Then he shouted loudly like the roaring of a lion . And when he shouted , the voices of seven thunders spoke .
When the seven thunders spoke , I started to write . But I heard a voice from heaven say , “ Keep hidden what the seven thunders said , and do not write them down . ”
Then the angel I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven ,
and he made a promise by the power of the One who lives forever and ever . He is the One who made the skies and all that is in them , the earth and all that is in it , and the sea and all that is in it . The angel promised , “ There will be no more waiting !
In the days when the seventh angel is ready to blow his trumpet , God ’ s secret will be finished . This secret is the Good News God told to his servants , the prophets . ”
Then I heard the same voice from heaven again , saying to me : “ Go and take the open scroll that is in the hand of the angel that is standing on the sea and on the land . ”
So I went to the angel and told him to give me the small scroll . And he said to me , “ Take the scroll and eat it . It will be sour in your stomach , but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey . ”
So I took the small scroll from the angel ’ s hand and ate it . In my mouth it tasted sweet as honey , but after I ate it , it was sour in my stomach .
Then I was told , “ You must prophesy again about many peoples , nations , languages , and kings . ”
I was given a measuring stick like a rod , and I was told , “ Go and measure the temple of God and the altar , and count the people worshiping there .
But do not measure the yard outside the temple . Leave it alone , because it has been given to those who are not God ’ s people . And they will trample on the holy city for forty-two months .
And I will give power to my two witnesses to prophesy for one thousand two hundred sixty days , and they will be dressed in rough cloth to show their sadness . ”
These two witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth .
And if anyone tries to hurt them , fire comes from their mouths and kills their enemies . And if anyone tries to hurt them in whatever way , in that same way that person will die .
These witnesses have the power to stop the sky from raining during the time they are prophesying . And they have power to make the waters become blood , and they have power to send every kind of trouble to the earth as many times as they want .
When the two witnesses have finished telling their message , the beast that comes up from the bottomless pit will fight a war against them . He will defeat them and kill them .
The bodies of the two witnesses will lie in the street of the great city where the Lord was killed . This city is named Sodom and Egypt , which has a spiritual meaning .
Those from every race of people , tribe , language , and nation will look at the bodies of the two witnesses for three and one-half days , and they will refuse to bury them .
People who live on the earth will rejoice and be happy because these two are dead . They will send each other gifts , because these two prophets brought much suffering to those who live on the earth .
But after three and one-half days , God put the breath of life into the two prophets again . They stood on their feet , and everyone who saw them became very afraid .
Then the two prophets heard a loud voice from heaven saying , “ Come up here ! ” And they went up into heaven in a cloud as their enemies watched .
In the same hour there was a great earthquake , and a tenth of the city was destroyed . Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake , and those who did not die were very afraid and gave glory to the God of heaven .
The second trouble is finished . Pay attention : The third trouble is coming soon .
Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet . And there were loud voices in heaven , saying : “ The power to rule the world now belongs to our Lord and his Christ , and he will rule forever and ever . ”
Then the twenty-four elders , who sit on their thrones before God , bowed down on their faces and worshiped God .
They said : “ We give thanks to you , Lord God Almighty , who is and who was , because you have used your great power and have begun to rule !
The people of the world were angry , but your anger has come . The time has come to judge the dead , and to reward your servants the prophets and your holy people , all who respect you , great and small . The time has come to destroy those who destroy the earth ! ”
Then God ’ s temple in heaven was opened . The Ark that holds the agreement God gave to his people could be seen in his temple . Then there were flashes of lightning , noises , thunder , an earthquake , and a great hailstorm .
And then a great wonder appeared in heaven : A woman was clothed with the sun , and the moon was under her feet , and a crown of twelve stars was on her head .
She was pregnant and cried out with pain , because she was about to give birth .
Then another wonder appeared in heaven : There was a giant red dragon with seven heads and seven crowns on each head . He also had ten horns .
His tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and threw them down to the earth . He stood in front of the woman who was ready to give birth so he could eat her baby as soon as it was born .
Then the woman gave birth to a son who will rule all the nations with an iron rod . And her child was taken up to God and to his throne .
The woman ran away into the desert to a place God prepared for her where she would be taken care of for one thousand two hundred sixty days .
Then there was a war in heaven . Michael and his angels fought against the dragon , and the dragon and his angels fought back .
But the dragon was not strong enough , and he and his angels lost their place in heaven .
The giant dragon was thrown down out of heaven . ( He is that old snake called the devil or Satan , who tricks the whole world . ) The dragon with his angels was thrown down to the earth .
Then I heard a loud voice in heaven saying : “ The salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have now come . The accuser of our brothers and sisters , who accused them day and night before our God , has been thrown down .
And our brothers and sisters defeated him by the blood of the Lamb ’ s death and by the message they preached . They did not love their lives so much that they were afraid of death .
So rejoice , you heavens and all who live there ! But it will be terrible for the earth and the sea , because the devil has come down to you ! He is filled with anger , because he knows he does not have much time . ”
When the dragon saw he had been thrown down to the earth , he hunted for the woman who had given birth to the son .
But the woman was given the two wings of a great eagle so she could fly to the place prepared for her in the desert . There she would be taken care of for three and one-half years , away from the snake .
Then the snake poured water out of its mouth like a river toward the woman so the flood would carry her away .
But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that came from the mouth of the dragon .
Then the dragon was very angry at the woman , and he went off to make war against all her other children — those who obey God ’ s commands and who have the message Jesus taught .
And the dragon stood on the seashore . Then I saw a beast coming up out of the sea . It had ten horns and seven heads , and there was a crown on each horn . A name against God was written on each head .
This beast looked like a leopard , with feet like a bear ’ s feet and a mouth like a lion ’ s mouth . And the dragon gave the beast all of his power and his throne and great authority .
One of the heads of the beast looked as if it had been killed by a wound , but this death wound was healed . Then the whole world was amazed and followed the beast .
People worshiped the dragon because he had given his power to the beast . And they also worshiped the beast , asking , “ Who is like the beast ? Who can make war against it ? ”
The beast was allowed to say proud words and words against God , and it was allowed to use its power for forty-two months .
It used its mouth to speak against God , against God ’ s name , against the place where God lives , and against all those who live in heaven .
It was given power to make war against God ’ s holy people and to defeat them . It was given power over every tribe , people , language , and nation .
And all who live on earth will worship the beast — all the people since the beginning of the world whose names are not written in the Lamb ’ s book of life . The Lamb is the One who was killed .
Anyone who has ears should listen :
If you are to be a prisoner , then you will be a prisoner . If you are to be killed with the sword , then you will be killed with the sword . This means that God ’ s holy people must have patience and faith .
Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth . It had two horns like a lamb , but it spoke like a dragon .
This beast stands before the first beast and uses the same power the first beast has . By this power it makes everyone living on earth worship the first beast , who had the death wound that was healed .
And the second beast does great miracles so that it even makes fire come down from heaven to earth while people are watching .
It fools those who live on earth by the miracles it has been given the power to do . It does these miracles to serve the first beast . The second beast orders people to make an idol to honor the first beast , the one that was wounded by the deadly sword but sprang to life again .
The second beast was given power to give life to the idol of the first one so that the idol could speak . And the second beast was given power to command all who will not worship the image of the beast to be killed .
The second beast also forced all people , small and great , rich and poor , free and slave , to have a mark on their right hand or on their forehead .
No one could buy or sell without this mark , which is the name of the beast or the number of its name .
This takes wisdom . Let the one who has understanding find the meaning of the number , which is the number of a person . Its number is 666 .
Then I looked , and there before me was the Lamb standing on Mount Zion . With him were one hundred forty-four thousand people who had his name and his Father ’ s name written on their foreheads .
And I heard a sound from heaven like the noise of flooding water and like the sound of loud thunder . The sound I heard was like people playing harps .
And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders . No one could learn the new song except the one hundred forty-four thousand who had been bought from the earth .
These are the ones who did not do sinful things with women , because they kept themselves pure . They follow the Lamb every place he goes . These one hundred forty-four thousand were bought from among the people of the earth as people to be offered to God and the Lamb .
They were not guilty of telling lies ; they are without fault .
Then I saw another angel flying high in the air . He had the eternal Good News to preach to those who live on earth — to every nation , tribe , language , and people .
He preached in a loud voice , “ Fear God and give him praise , because the time has come for God to judge all people . So worship God who made the heavens , and the earth , and the sea , and the springs of water . ”
Then the second angel followed the first angel and said , “ Ruined , ruined is the great city of Babylon ! She made all the nations drink the wine of the anger of her adultery . ”
Then a third angel followed the first two angels , saying in a loud voice : “ If anyone worships the beast and his idol and gets the beast ’ s mark on the forehead or on the hand ,
that one also will drink the wine of God ’ s anger , which is prepared with all its strength in the cup of his anger . And that person will be put in pain with burning sulfur before the holy angels and the Lamb .
And the smoke from their burning pain will rise forever and ever . There will be no rest , day or night , for those who worship the beast and his idol or who get the mark of his name . ”
This means God ’ s holy people must be patient . They must obey God ’ s commands and keep their faith in Jesus .
Then I heard a voice from heaven saying , “ Write this : Blessed are the dead who die from now on in the Lord . ” The Spirit says , “ Yes , they will rest from their hard work , and the reward of all they have done stays with them . ”
Then I looked , and there before me was a white cloud , and sitting on the white cloud was One who looked like a Son of Man . He had a gold crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand .
Then another angel came out of the temple and called out in a loud voice to the One who was sitting on the cloud , “ Take your sickle and harvest from the earth , because the time to harvest has come , and the fruit of the earth is ripe . ”
