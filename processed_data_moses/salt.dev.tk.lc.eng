then i heard all creatures in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea saying : “ to the one who sits on the throne and to the lamb be praise and honor and glory and power forever and ever . ”
the four living creatures said , “ amen , ” and the elders bowed down and worshiped .
then i watched while the lamb opened the first of the seven seals . i heard one of the four living creatures say with a voice like thunder , “ come ! ”
i looked , and there before me was a white horse . the rider on the horse held a bow , and he was given a crown , and he rode out , determined to win the victory .
when the lamb opened the second seal , i heard the second living creature say , “ come ! ”
then another horse came out , a red one . its rider was given power to take away peace from the earth and to make people kill each other , and he was given a big sword .
when the lamb opened the third seal , i heard the third living creature say , “ come ! ” i looked , and there before me was a black horse , and its rider held a pair of scales in his hand .
then i heard something that sounded like a voice coming from the middle of the four living creatures . the voice said , “ a quart of wheat for a day ’ s pay , and three quarts of barley for a day ’ s pay , and do not damage the olive oil and wine ! ”
when the lamb opened the fourth seal , i heard the voice of the fourth living creature say , “ come ! ”
i looked , and there before me was a pale horse . its rider was named death , and hades was following close behind him . they were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill people by war , by starvation , by disease , and by the wild animals of the earth .
when the lamb opened the fifth seal , i saw under the altar the souls of those who had been killed because they were faithful to the word of god and to the message they had received .
these souls shouted in a loud voice , “ holy and true lord , how long until you judge the people of the earth and punish them for killing us ? ”
then each one of them was given a white robe and was told to wait a short time longer . there were still some of their fellow servants and brothers and sisters in the service of christ who must be killed as they were . they had to wait until all of this was finished .
then i watched while the lamb opened the sixth seal , and there was a great earthquake . the sun became black like rough black cloth , and the whole moon became red like blood .
and the stars in the sky fell to the earth like figs falling from a fig tree when the wind blows .
the sky disappeared as a scroll when it is rolled up , and every mountain and island was moved from its place .
then the kings of the earth , the rulers , the generals , the rich people , the powerful people , the slaves , and the free people hid themselves in caves and in the rocks on the mountains .
they called to the mountains and the rocks , “ fall on us . hide us from the face of the one who sits on the throne and from the anger of the lamb !
the great day for their anger has come , and who can stand against it ? ”
after the vision of these things i saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth . the angels were holding the four winds of the earth to keep them from blowing on the land or on the sea or on any tree .
then i saw another angel coming up from the east who had the seal of the living god . and he called out in a loud voice to the four angels to whom god had given power to harm the earth and the sea .
he said to them , “ do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we mark with a sign the foreheads of the people who serve our god . ”
then i heard how many people were marked with the sign . there were one hundred forty-four thousand from every tribe of the people of israel .
from the tribe of judah twelve thousand were marked with the sign , from the tribe of reuben twelve thousand , from the tribe of gad twelve thousand ,
from the tribe of asher twelve thousand , from the tribe of naphtali twelve thousand , from the tribe of manasseh twelve thousand ,
from the tribe of simeon twelve thousand , from the tribe of levi twelve thousand , from the tribe of issachar twelve thousand ,
from the tribe of zebulun twelve thousand , from the tribe of joseph twelve thousand , and from the tribe of benjamin twelve thousand were marked with the sign .
after the vision of these things i looked , and there was a great number of people , so many that no one could count them . they were from every nation , tribe , people , and language of the earth . they were all standing before the throne and before the lamb , wearing white robes and holding palm branches in their hands .
they were shouting in a loud voice , “ salvation belongs to our god , who sits on the throne , and to the lamb . ”
all the angels were standing around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures . they all bowed down on their faces before the throne and worshiped god ,
saying , “ amen ! praise , glory , wisdom , thanks , honor , power , and strength belong to our god forever and ever . amen ! ”
then one of the elders asked me , “ who are these people dressed in white robes ? where did they come from ? ”
i answered , “ you know , sir . ” and the elder said to me , “ these are the people who have come out of the great distress . they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb .
because of this , they are before the throne of god . they worship him day and night in his temple . and the one who sits on the throne will be present with them .
those people will never be hungry again , and they will never be thirsty again . the sun will not hurt them , and no heat will burn them ,
because the lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd . he will lead them to springs of water that give life . and god will wipe away every tear from their eyes . ”
when the lamb opened the seventh seal , there was silence in heaven for about half an hour .
and i saw the seven angels who stand before god and to whom were given seven trumpets .
another angel came and stood at the altar , holding a golden pan for incense . he was given much incense to offer with the prayers of all god ’ s holy people . the angel put this offering on the golden altar before the throne .
the smoke from the incense went up from the angel ’ s hand to god with the prayers of god ’ s people .
then the angel filled the incense pan with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth , and there were flashes of lightning , thunder and loud noises , and an earthquake .
then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to blow them .
the first angel blew his trumpet , and hail and fire mixed with blood were poured down on the earth . and a third of the earth , and all the green grass , and a third of the trees were burned up .
then the second angel blew his trumpet , and something that looked like a big mountain , burning with fire , was thrown into the sea . and a third of the sea became blood ,
a third of the living things in the sea died , and a third of the ships were destroyed .
then the third angel blew his trumpet , and a large star , burning like a torch , fell from the sky . it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water .
the name of the star is wormwood . and a third of all the water became bitter , and many people died from drinking the water that was bitter .
then the fourth angel blew his trumpet , and a third of the sun , and a third of the moon , and a third of the stars were struck . so a third of them became dark , and a third of the day was without light , and also the night .
while i watched , i heard an eagle that was flying high in the air cry out in a loud voice , “ trouble ! trouble ! trouble for those who live on the earth because of the remaining sounds of the trumpets that the other three angels are about to blow ! ”
then the fifth angel blew his trumpet , and i saw a star fall from the sky to the earth . the star was given the key to the deep hole that leads to the bottomless pit .
then it opened up the hole that leads to the bottomless pit , and smoke came up from the hole like smoke from a big furnace . then the sun and sky became dark because of the smoke from the hole .
then locusts came down to the earth out of the smoke , and they were given the power to sting like scorpions .
they were told not to harm the grass on the earth or any plant or tree . they could harm only the people who did not have the sign of god on their foreheads .
these locusts were not given the power to kill anyone , but to cause pain to the people for five months . and the pain they felt was like the pain a scorpion gives when it stings someone .
during those days people will look for a way to die , but they will not find it . they will want to die , but death will run away from them .
the locusts looked like horses prepared for battle . on their heads they wore what looked like crowns of gold , and their faces looked like human faces .
their hair was like women ’ s hair , and their teeth were like lions ’ teeth .
their chests looked like iron breastplates , and the sound of their wings was like the noise of many horses and chariots hurrying into battle .
the locusts had tails with stingers like scorpions , and in their tails was their power to hurt people for five months .
the locusts had a king who was the angel of the bottomless pit . his name in the hebrew language is abaddon and in the greek language is apollyon .
the first trouble is past ; there are still two other troubles that will come .
then the sixth angel blew his trumpet , and i heard a voice coming from the horns on the golden altar that is before god .
the voice said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet , “ free the four angels who are tied at the great river euphrates . ”
and they let loose the four angels who had been kept ready for this hour and day and month and year so they could kill a third of all people on the earth .
i heard how many troops on horses were in their army — two hundred million .
the horses and their riders i saw in the vision looked like this : they had breastplates that were fiery red , dark blue , and yellow like sulfur . the heads of the horses looked like heads of lions , with fire , smoke , and sulfur coming out of their mouths .
a third of all the people on earth were killed by these three terrible disasters coming out of the horses ’ mouths : the fire , the smoke , and the sulfur .
the horses ’ power was in their mouths and in their tails ; their tails were like snakes with heads , and with them they hurt people .
the other people who were not killed by these terrible disasters still did not change their hearts and turn away from what they had made with their own hands . they did not stop worshiping demons and idols made of gold , silver , bronze , stone , and wood — things that cannot see or hear or walk .
these people did not change their hearts and turn away from murder or evil magic , from their sexual sins or stealing .
then i saw another powerful angel coming down from heaven dressed in a cloud with a rainbow over his head . his face was like the sun , and his legs were like pillars of fire .
the angel was holding a small scroll open in his hand . he put his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land .
then he shouted loudly like the roaring of a lion . and when he shouted , the voices of seven thunders spoke .
when the seven thunders spoke , i started to write . but i heard a voice from heaven say , “ keep hidden what the seven thunders said , and do not write them down . ”
then the angel i saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven ,
and he made a promise by the power of the one who lives forever and ever . he is the one who made the skies and all that is in them , the earth and all that is in it , and the sea and all that is in it . the angel promised , “ there will be no more waiting !
in the days when the seventh angel is ready to blow his trumpet , god ’ s secret will be finished . this secret is the good news god told to his servants , the prophets . ”
then i heard the same voice from heaven again , saying to me : “ go and take the open scroll that is in the hand of the angel that is standing on the sea and on the land . ”
so i went to the angel and told him to give me the small scroll . and he said to me , “ take the scroll and eat it . it will be sour in your stomach , but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey . ”
so i took the small scroll from the angel ’ s hand and ate it . in my mouth it tasted sweet as honey , but after i ate it , it was sour in my stomach .
then i was told , “ you must prophesy again about many peoples , nations , languages , and kings . ”
i was given a measuring stick like a rod , and i was told , “ go and measure the temple of god and the altar , and count the people worshiping there .
but do not measure the yard outside the temple . leave it alone , because it has been given to those who are not god ’ s people . and they will trample on the holy city for forty-two months .
and i will give power to my two witnesses to prophesy for one thousand two hundred sixty days , and they will be dressed in rough cloth to show their sadness . ”
these two witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the lord of the earth .
and if anyone tries to hurt them , fire comes from their mouths and kills their enemies . and if anyone tries to hurt them in whatever way , in that same way that person will die .
these witnesses have the power to stop the sky from raining during the time they are prophesying . and they have power to make the waters become blood , and they have power to send every kind of trouble to the earth as many times as they want .
when the two witnesses have finished telling their message , the beast that comes up from the bottomless pit will fight a war against them . he will defeat them and kill them .
the bodies of the two witnesses will lie in the street of the great city where the lord was killed . this city is named sodom and egypt , which has a spiritual meaning .
those from every race of people , tribe , language , and nation will look at the bodies of the two witnesses for three and one-half days , and they will refuse to bury them .
people who live on the earth will rejoice and be happy because these two are dead . they will send each other gifts , because these two prophets brought much suffering to those who live on the earth .
but after three and one-half days , god put the breath of life into the two prophets again . they stood on their feet , and everyone who saw them became very afraid .
then the two prophets heard a loud voice from heaven saying , “ come up here ! ” and they went up into heaven in a cloud as their enemies watched .
in the same hour there was a great earthquake , and a tenth of the city was destroyed . seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake , and those who did not die were very afraid and gave glory to the god of heaven .
the second trouble is finished . pay attention : the third trouble is coming soon .
then the seventh angel blew his trumpet . and there were loud voices in heaven , saying : “ the power to rule the world now belongs to our lord and his christ , and he will rule forever and ever . ”
then the twenty-four elders , who sit on their thrones before god , bowed down on their faces and worshiped god .
they said : “ we give thanks to you , lord god almighty , who is and who was , because you have used your great power and have begun to rule !
the people of the world were angry , but your anger has come . the time has come to judge the dead , and to reward your servants the prophets and your holy people , all who respect you , great and small . the time has come to destroy those who destroy the earth ! ”
then god ’ s temple in heaven was opened . the ark that holds the agreement god gave to his people could be seen in his temple . then there were flashes of lightning , noises , thunder , an earthquake , and a great hailstorm .
and then a great wonder appeared in heaven : a woman was clothed with the sun , and the moon was under her feet , and a crown of twelve stars was on her head .
she was pregnant and cried out with pain , because she was about to give birth .
then another wonder appeared in heaven : there was a giant red dragon with seven heads and seven crowns on each head . he also had ten horns .
his tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and threw them down to the earth . he stood in front of the woman who was ready to give birth so he could eat her baby as soon as it was born .
then the woman gave birth to a son who will rule all the nations with an iron rod . and her child was taken up to god and to his throne .
the woman ran away into the desert to a place god prepared for her where she would be taken care of for one thousand two hundred sixty days .
then there was a war in heaven . michael and his angels fought against the dragon , and the dragon and his angels fought back .
but the dragon was not strong enough , and he and his angels lost their place in heaven .
the giant dragon was thrown down out of heaven . ( he is that old snake called the devil or satan , who tricks the whole world . ) the dragon with his angels was thrown down to the earth .
then i heard a loud voice in heaven saying : “ the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our god and the authority of his christ have now come . the accuser of our brothers and sisters , who accused them day and night before our god , has been thrown down .
and our brothers and sisters defeated him by the blood of the lamb ’ s death and by the message they preached . they did not love their lives so much that they were afraid of death .
so rejoice , you heavens and all who live there ! but it will be terrible for the earth and the sea , because the devil has come down to you ! he is filled with anger , because he knows he does not have much time . ”
when the dragon saw he had been thrown down to the earth , he hunted for the woman who had given birth to the son .
but the woman was given the two wings of a great eagle so she could fly to the place prepared for her in the desert . there she would be taken care of for three and one-half years , away from the snake .
then the snake poured water out of its mouth like a river toward the woman so the flood would carry her away .
but the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that came from the mouth of the dragon .
then the dragon was very angry at the woman , and he went off to make war against all her other children — those who obey god ’ s commands and who have the message jesus taught .
and the dragon stood on the seashore . then i saw a beast coming up out of the sea . it had ten horns and seven heads , and there was a crown on each horn . a name against god was written on each head .
this beast looked like a leopard , with feet like a bear ’ s feet and a mouth like a lion ’ s mouth . and the dragon gave the beast all of his power and his throne and great authority .
one of the heads of the beast looked as if it had been killed by a wound , but this death wound was healed . then the whole world was amazed and followed the beast .
people worshiped the dragon because he had given his power to the beast . and they also worshiped the beast , asking , “ who is like the beast ? who can make war against it ? ”
the beast was allowed to say proud words and words against god , and it was allowed to use its power for forty-two months .
it used its mouth to speak against god , against god ’ s name , against the place where god lives , and against all those who live in heaven .
it was given power to make war against god ’ s holy people and to defeat them . it was given power over every tribe , people , language , and nation .
and all who live on earth will worship the beast — all the people since the beginning of the world whose names are not written in the lamb ’ s book of life . the lamb is the one who was killed .
anyone who has ears should listen :
if you are to be a prisoner , then you will be a prisoner . if you are to be killed with the sword , then you will be killed with the sword . this means that god ’ s holy people must have patience and faith .
then i saw another beast coming up out of the earth . it had two horns like a lamb , but it spoke like a dragon .
this beast stands before the first beast and uses the same power the first beast has . by this power it makes everyone living on earth worship the first beast , who had the death wound that was healed .
and the second beast does great miracles so that it even makes fire come down from heaven to earth while people are watching .
it fools those who live on earth by the miracles it has been given the power to do . it does these miracles to serve the first beast . the second beast orders people to make an idol to honor the first beast , the one that was wounded by the deadly sword but sprang to life again .
the second beast was given power to give life to the idol of the first one so that the idol could speak . and the second beast was given power to command all who will not worship the image of the beast to be killed .
the second beast also forced all people , small and great , rich and poor , free and slave , to have a mark on their right hand or on their forehead .
no one could buy or sell without this mark , which is the name of the beast or the number of its name .
this takes wisdom . let the one who has understanding find the meaning of the number , which is the number of a person . its number is 666 .
then i looked , and there before me was the lamb standing on mount zion . with him were one hundred forty-four thousand people who had his name and his father ’ s name written on their foreheads .
and i heard a sound from heaven like the noise of flooding water and like the sound of loud thunder . the sound i heard was like people playing harps .
and they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders . no one could learn the new song except the one hundred forty-four thousand who had been bought from the earth .
these are the ones who did not do sinful things with women , because they kept themselves pure . they follow the lamb every place he goes . these one hundred forty-four thousand were bought from among the people of the earth as people to be offered to god and the lamb .
they were not guilty of telling lies ; they are without fault .
then i saw another angel flying high in the air . he had the eternal good news to preach to those who live on earth — to every nation , tribe , language , and people .
he preached in a loud voice , “ fear god and give him praise , because the time has come for god to judge all people . so worship god who made the heavens , and the earth , and the sea , and the springs of water . ”
then the second angel followed the first angel and said , “ ruined , ruined is the great city of babylon ! she made all the nations drink the wine of the anger of her adultery . ”
then a third angel followed the first two angels , saying in a loud voice : “ if anyone worships the beast and his idol and gets the beast ’ s mark on the forehead or on the hand ,
that one also will drink the wine of god ’ s anger , which is prepared with all its strength in the cup of his anger . and that person will be put in pain with burning sulfur before the holy angels and the lamb .
and the smoke from their burning pain will rise forever and ever . there will be no rest , day or night , for those who worship the beast and his idol or who get the mark of his name . ”
this means god ’ s holy people must be patient . they must obey god ’ s commands and keep their faith in jesus .
then i heard a voice from heaven saying , “ write this : blessed are the dead who die from now on in the lord . ” the spirit says , “ yes , they will rest from their hard work , and the reward of all they have done stays with them . ”
then i looked , and there before me was a white cloud , and sitting on the white cloud was one who looked like a son of man . he had a gold crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand .
then another angel came out of the temple and called out in a loud voice to the one who was sitting on the cloud , “ take your sickle and harvest from the earth , because the time to harvest has come , and the fruit of the earth is ripe . ”
