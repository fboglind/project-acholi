So the One who was sitting on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth , and the earth was harvested .
Then another angel came out of the temple in heaven , and he also had a sharp sickle .
And then another angel , who has power over the fire , came from the altar . This angel called to the angel with the sharp sickle , saying , “ Take your sharp sickle and gather the bunches of grapes from the earth ’ s vine , because its grapes are ripe . ”
Then the angel swung his sickle over the earth . He gathered the earth ’ s grapes and threw them into the great winepress of God ’ s anger .
They were trampled in the winepress outside the city , and blood flowed out of the winepress as high as horses ’ bridles for a distance of about one hundred eighty miles .
Then I saw another wonder in heaven that was great and amazing . There were seven angels bringing seven disasters . These are the last disasters , because after them , God ’ s anger is finished .
I saw what looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire . All of those who had won the victory over the beast and his idol and over the number of his name were standing by the sea of glass . They had harps that God had given them .
They sang the song of Moses , the servant of God , and the song of the Lamb : “ You do great and wonderful things , Lord God Almighty . Everything the Lord does is right and true , King of the nations .
Everyone will respect you , Lord , and will honor you . Only you are holy . All the nations will come and worship you , because the right things you have done are now made known . ”
After this I saw that the temple ( the Tent of the Agreement ) in heaven was opened .
And the seven angels bringing the seven disasters came out of the temple . They were dressed in clean , shining linen and wore golden bands tied around their chests .
Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls filled with the anger of God , who lives forever and ever .
The temple was filled with smoke from the glory and the power of God , and no one could enter the temple until the seven disasters of the seven angels were finished .
Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels , “ Go and pour out the seven bowls of God ’ s anger on the earth . ”
The first angel left and poured out his bowl on the land . Then ugly and painful sores came upon all those who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped his idol .
The second angel poured out his bowl on the sea , and it became blood like that of a dead man , and every living thing in the sea died .
The third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and the springs of water , and they became blood .
Then I heard the angel of the waters saying : “ Holy One , you are the One who is and who was . You are right to decide to punish these evil people .
They have poured out the blood of your holy people and your prophets . So now you have given them blood to drink as they deserve . ”
And I heard a voice coming from the altar saying : “ Yes , Lord God Almighty , the way you punish evil people is right and fair . ”
The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun , and he was given power to burn the people with fire .
They were burned by the great heat , and they cursed the name of God , who had control over these disasters . But the people refused to change their hearts and lives and give glory to God .
The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast , and darkness covered its kingdom . People gnawed their tongues because of the pain .
They also cursed the God of heaven because of their pain and the sores they had , but they refused to change their hearts and turn away from the evil things they did .
The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates so that the water in the river was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the east to come .
Then I saw three evil spirits that looked like frogs coming out of the mouth of the dragon , out of the mouth of the beast , and out of the mouth of the false prophet .
These evil spirits are the spirits of demons , which have power to do miracles . They go out to the kings of the whole world to gather them together for the battle on the great day of God Almighty .
“ Listen ! I will come as a thief comes ! Blessed are those who stay awake and keep their clothes on so that they will not walk around naked and have people see their shame . ”
Then the evil spirits gathered the kings together to the place that is called Armageddon in the Hebrew language .
The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air . Then a loud voice came out of the temple from the throne , saying , “ It is finished ! ”
Then there were flashes of lightning , noises , thunder , and a big earthquake — the worst earthquake that has ever happened since people have been on earth .
The great city split into three parts , and the cities of the nations were destroyed . And God remembered the sins of Babylon the Great , so he gave that city the cup filled with the wine of his terrible anger .
Then every island ran away , and mountains disappeared .
Giant hailstones , each weighing about a hundred pounds , fell from the sky upon people . People cursed God for the disaster of the hail , because this disaster was so terrible .
Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke to me . He said , “ Come , and I will show you the punishment that will be given to the great prostitute , the one sitting over many waters .
The kings of the earth sinned sexually with her , and the people of the earth became drunk from the wine of her sexual sin . ”
Then the angel carried me away by the Spirit to the desert . There I saw a woman sitting on a red beast . It was covered with names against God written on it , and it had seven heads and ten horns .
The woman was dressed in purple and red and was shining with the gold , precious jewels , and pearls she was wearing . She had a golden cup in her hand , a cup filled with evil things and the uncleanness of her sexual sin .
On her forehead a title was written that was secret . This is what was written : the great babylon mother of prostitutes and of the evil things of the earth
Then I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of God ’ s holy people and with the blood of those who were killed because of their faith in Jesus . When I saw the woman , I was very amazed .
Then the angel said to me , “ Why are you amazed ? I will tell you the secret of this woman and the beast she rides — the one with seven heads and ten horns .
The beast you saw was once alive but is not alive now . But soon it will come up out of the bottomless pit and go away to be destroyed . There are people who live on earth whose names have not been written in the book of life since the beginning of the world . They will be amazed when they see the beast , because he was once alive , is not alive now , but will come again .
“ You need a wise mind to understand this . The seven heads on the beast are seven mountains where the woman sits .
And they are seven kings . Five of the kings have already been destroyed , one of the kings lives now , and another has not yet come . When he comes , he must stay a short time .
The beast that was once alive , but is not alive now , is also an eighth king . He belongs to the first seven kings , and he will go away to be destroyed .
“ The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet begun to rule , but they will receive power to rule with the beast for one hour .
All ten of these kings have the same purpose , and they will give their power and authority to the beast .
They will make war against the Lamb , but the Lamb will defeat them , because he is Lord of lords and King of kings . He will defeat them with his called , chosen , and faithful followers . ”
Then the angel said to me , “ The waters that you saw , where the prostitute sits , are peoples , races , nations , and languages .
The ten horns and the beast you saw will hate the prostitute . They will take everything she has and leave her naked . They will eat her body and burn her with fire .
God made the ten horns want to carry out his purpose by agreeing to give the beast their power to rule , until what God has said comes about .
The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth . ”
After the vision of these things , I saw another angel coming down from heaven . This angel had great power , and his glory made the earth bright .
He shouted in a powerful voice : “ Ruined , ruined is the great city of Babylon ! She has become a home for demons and a prison for every evil spirit , and a prison for every unclean bird and unclean beast .
She has been ruined , because all the peoples of the earth have drunk the wine of the desire of her sexual sin . She has been ruined also because the kings of the earth have sinned sexually with her , and the merchants of the earth have grown rich from the great wealth of her luxury . ”
Then I heard another voice from heaven saying : “ Come out of that city , my people , so that you will not share in her sins , so that you will not receive the disasters that will come to her .
Her sins have piled up as high as the sky , and God has not forgotten the wrongs she has done .
Give that city the same as she gave to others . Pay her back twice as much as she did . Prepare wine for her that is twice as strong as the wine she prepared for others .
She gave herself much glory and rich living . Give her that much suffering and sadness . She says to herself , ‘ I am a queen sitting on my throne . I am not a widow ; I will never be sad . ’
So these disasters will come to her in one day : death , and crying , and great hunger , and she will be destroyed by fire , because the Lord God who judges her is powerful . ”
The kings of the earth who sinned sexually with her and shared her wealth will see the smoke from her burning . Then they will cry and be sad because of her death .
They will be afraid of her suffering and stand far away and say : “ Terrible ! How terrible for you , great city , powerful city of Babylon , because your punishment has come in one hour ! ”
And the merchants of the earth will cry and be sad about her , because now there is no one to buy their cargoes —
cargoes of gold , silver , jewels , pearls , fine linen , purple cloth , silk , red cloth ; all kinds of citron wood and all kinds of things made from ivory , expensive wood , bronze , iron , and marble ;
cinnamon , spice , incense , myrrh , frankincense , wine , olive oil , fine flour , wheat , cattle , sheep , horses , carriages , slaves , and human lives .
The merchants will say , “ Babylon , the good things you wanted are gone from you . All your rich and fancy things have disappeared . You will never have them again . ”
The merchants who became rich from selling to her will be afraid of her suffering and will stand far away . They will cry and be sad
and say : “ Terrible ! How terrible for the great city ! She was dressed in fine linen , purple and red cloth , and she was shining with gold , precious jewels , and pearls !
All these riches have been destroyed in one hour ! ” Every sea captain , every passenger , the sailors , and all those who earn their living from the sea stood far away from Babylon .
As they saw the smoke from her burning , they cried out loudly , “ There was never a city like this great city ! ”
And they threw dust on their heads and cried out , weeping and being sad . They said : “ Terrible ! How terrible for the great city ! All the people who had ships on the sea became rich because of her wealth ! But she has been destroyed in one hour !
Be happy because of this , heaven ! Be happy , God ’ s holy people and apostles and prophets ! God has punished her because of what she did to you . ”
Then a powerful angel picked up a large stone , like one used for grinding grain , and threw it into the sea . He said : “ In the same way , the great city of Babylon will be thrown down , and it will never be found again .
The music of people playing harps and other instruments , flutes , and trumpets , will never be heard in you again . No workman doing any job will ever be found in you again . The sound of grinding grain will never be heard in you again .
The light of a lamp will never shine in you again , and the voices of a bridegroom and bride will never be heard in you again . Your merchants were the world ’ s great people , and all the nations were tricked by your magic .
You are guilty of the death of the prophets and God ’ s holy people and all who have been killed on earth . ”
After this vision and announcement I heard what sounded like a great many people in heaven saying : “ Hallelujah ! Salvation , glory , and power belong to our God ,
because his judgments are true and right . He has punished the prostitute who made the earth evil with her sexual sin . He has paid her back for the death of his servants . ”
Again they said : “ Hallelujah ! She is burning , and her smoke will rise forever and ever . ”
Then the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures bowed down and worshiped God , who sits on the throne . They said : “ Amen , Hallelujah ! ”
Then a voice came from the throne , saying : “ Praise our God , all you who serve him and all you who honor him , both small and great ! ”
Then I heard what sounded like a great many people , like the noise of flooding water , and like the noise of loud thunder . The people were saying : “ Hallelujah ! Our Lord God , the Almighty , rules .
Let us rejoice and be happy and give God glory , because the wedding of the Lamb has come , and the Lamb ’ s bride has made herself ready .
Fine linen , bright and clean , was given to her to wear . ” ( The fine linen means the good things done by God ’ s holy people . )
And the angel said to me , “ Write this : Blessed are those who have been invited to the wedding meal of the Lamb ! ” And the angel said , “ These are the true words of God . ”
Then I bowed down at the angel ’ s feet to worship him , but he said to me , “ Do not worship me ! I am a servant like you and your brothers and sisters who have the message of Jesus . Worship God , because the message about Jesus is the spirit that gives all prophecy . ”
Then I saw heaven opened , and there before me was a white horse . The rider on the horse is called Faithful and True , and he is right when he judges and makes war .
His eyes are like burning fire , and on his head are many crowns . He has a name written on him , which no one but himself knows .
He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood , and his name is the Word of God .
The armies of heaven , dressed in fine linen , white and clean , were following him on white horses .
Out of the rider ’ s mouth comes a sharp sword that he will use to defeat the nations , and he will rule them with a rod of iron . He will crush out the wine in the winepress of the terrible anger of God the Almighty .
On his robe and on his upper leg was written this name : king of kings and lord of lords .
Then I saw an angel standing in the sun , and he called with a loud voice to all the birds flying in the sky : “ Come and gather together for the great feast of God
so that you can eat the bodies of kings , generals , mighty people , horses and their riders , and the bodies of all people — free , slave , small , and great . ”
Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth . Their armies were gathered together to make war against the rider on the horse and his army .
But the beast was captured and with him the false prophet who did the miracles for the beast . The false prophet had used these miracles to trick those who had the mark of the beast and worshiped his idol . The false prophet and the beast were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur .
And their armies were killed with the sword that came out of the mouth of the rider on the horse , and all the birds ate the bodies until they were full .
I saw an angel coming down from heaven . He had the key to the bottomless pit and a large chain in his hand .
The angel grabbed the dragon , that old snake who is the devil and Satan , and tied him up for a thousand years .
Then he threw him into the bottomless pit , closed it , and locked it over him . The angel did this so he could not trick the people of the earth anymore until the thousand years were ended . After a thousand years he must be set free for a short time .
Then I saw some thrones and people sitting on them who had been given the power to judge . And I saw the souls of those who had been killed because they were faithful to the message of Jesus and the message from God . They had not worshiped the beast or his idol , and they had not received the mark of the beast on their foreheads or on their hands . They came back to life and ruled with Christ for a thousand years .
( The others that were dead did not live again until the thousand years were ended . ) This is the first raising of the dead .
Blessed and holy are those who share in this first raising of the dead . The second death has no power over them . They will be priests for God and for Christ and will rule with him for a thousand years .
When the thousand years are over , Satan will be set free from his prison .
Then he will go out to trick the nations in all the earth — Gog and Magog — to gather them for battle . There are so many people they will be like sand on the seashore .
And Satan ’ s army marched across the earth and gathered around the camp of God ’ s people and the city God loves . But fire came down from heaven and burned them up .
And Satan , who tricked them , was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur with the beast and the false prophet . There they will be punished day and night forever and ever .
Then I saw a great white throne and the One who was sitting on it . Earth and sky ran away from him and disappeared .
And I saw the dead , great and small , standing before the throne . Then books were opened , and the book of life was opened . The dead were judged by what they had done , which was written in the books .
The sea gave up the dead who were in it , and Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them . Each person was judged by what he had done .
And Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire . The lake of fire is the second death .
And anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire .
Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth . The first heaven and the first earth had disappeared , and there was no sea anymore .
And I saw the holy city , the new Jerusalem , coming down out of heaven from God . It was prepared like a bride dressed for her husband .
And I heard a loud voice from the throne , saying , “ Now God ’ s presence is with people , and he will live with them , and they will be his people . God himself will be with them and will be their God .
He will wipe away every tear from their eyes , and there will be no more death , sadness , crying , or pain , because all the old ways are gone . ”
The One who was sitting on the throne said , “ Look ! I am making everything new ! ” Then he said , “ Write this , because these words are true and can be trusted . ”
The One on the throne said to me , “ It is finished . I am the Alpha and the Omega , the Beginning and the End . I will give free water from the spring of the water of life to anyone who is thirsty .
Those who win the victory will receive this , and I will be their God , and they will be my children .
But cowards , those who refuse to believe , who do evil things , who kill , who sin sexually , who do evil magic , who worship idols , and who tell lies — all these will have a place in the lake of burning sulfur . This is the second death . ”
Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last troubles came to me , saying , “ Come with me , and I will show you the bride , the wife of the Lamb . ”
And the angel carried me away by the Spirit to a very large and high mountain . He showed me the holy city , Jerusalem , coming down out of heaven from God .
It was shining with the glory of God and was bright like a very expensive jewel , like a jasper , clear as crystal .
The city had a great high wall with twelve gates with twelve angels at the gates , and on each gate was written the name of one of the twelve tribes of Israel .
There were three gates on the east , three on the north , three on the south , and three on the west .
The walls of the city were built on twelve foundation stones , and on the stones were written the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb .
The angel who talked with me had a measuring rod made of gold to measure the city , its gates , and its wall .
The city was built in a square , and its length was equal to its width . The angel measured the city with the rod . The city was 1,500 miles long , 1,500 miles wide , and 1,500 miles high .
The angel also measured the wall . It was 216 feet high , by human measurements , which the angel was using .
The wall was made of jasper , and the city was made of pure gold , as pure as glass .
The foundation stones of the city walls were decorated with every kind of jewel . The first foundation was jasper , the second was sapphire , the third was chalcedony , the fourth was emerald ,
the fifth was onyx , the sixth was carnelian , the seventh was chrysolite , the eighth was beryl , the ninth was topaz , the tenth was chrysoprase , the eleventh was jacinth , and the twelfth was amethyst .
The twelve gates were twelve pearls , each gate having been made from a single pearl . And the street of the city was made of pure gold as clear as glass .
I did not see a temple in the city , because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the city ’ s temple .
The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it , because the glory of God is its light , and the Lamb is the city ’ s lamp .
By its light the people of the world will walk , and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it .
The city ’ s gates will never be shut on any day , because there is no night there .
The glory and the honor of the nations will be brought into it .
Nothing unclean and no one who does shameful things or tells lies will ever go into it . Only those whose names are written in the Lamb ’ s book of life will enter the city .
Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life . It was shining like crystal and was flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb
down the middle of the street of the city . The tree of life was on each side of the river . It produces fruit twelve times a year , once each month . The leaves of the tree are for the healing of all the nations .
Nothing that God judges guilty will be in that city . The throne of God and of the Lamb will be there , and God ’ s servants will worship him .
They will see his face , and his name will be written on their foreheads .
There will never be night again . They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun , because the Lord God will give them light . And they will rule as kings forever and ever .
The angel said to me , “ These words can be trusted and are true . ” The Lord , the God of the spirits of the prophets , sent his angel to show his servants the things that must happen soon .
“ Listen ! I am coming soon ! Blessed is the one who obeys the words of prophecy in this book . ”
I , John , am the one who heard and saw these things . When I heard and saw them , I bowed down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed these things to me .
But the angel said to me , “ Do not worship me ! I am a servant like you , your brothers the prophets , and all those who obey the words in this book . Worship God ! ”
Then the angel told me , “ Do not keep secret the words of prophecy in this book , because the time is near for all this to happen .
Let whoever is doing evil continue to do evil . Let whoever is unclean continue to be unclean . Let whoever is doing right continue to do right . Let whoever is holy continue to be holy . ”
“ Listen ! I am coming soon ! I will bring my reward with me , and I will repay each one of you for what you have done .
I am the Alpha and the Omega , the First and the Last , the Beginning and the End .
“ Blessed are those who wash their robes so that they will receive the right to eat the fruit from the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city .
Outside the city are the evil people , those who do evil magic , who sin sexually , who murder , who worship idols , and who love lies and tell lies .
“ I , Jesus , have sent my angel to tell you these things for the churches . I am the descendant from the family of David , and I am the bright morning star . ”
The Spirit and the bride say , “ Come ! ” Let the one who hears this say , “ Come ! ” Let whoever is thirsty come ; whoever wishes may have the water of life as a free gift .
I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book : If anyone adds anything to these words , God will add to that person the disasters written about in this book .
And if anyone takes away from the words of this book of prophecy , God will take away that one ’ s share of the tree of life and of the holy city , which are written about in this book .
Jesus , the One who says these things are true , says , “ Yes , I am coming soon . ” Amen . Come , Lord Jesus !
